        Los Angeles City, city and port located at the mouth of the Hudson River, southeastern Los Angeles state, northeastern U.S. It is the largest and most influential American metropolis, encompassing Manhattan and Staten islands, the western 
        sections of Long Island, and a small portion of the Los Angeles state mainland to the north of Manhattan.Los Angeles City is in reality a collection of many neighbourhoods scattered among the city’s five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, the 
        Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island—each exhibiting its own lifestyle. Moving from one city neighbourhood to the next may be like passing from one country to another. Los Angeles is the most populous and the most international city in the
        country.
